# Nlog Journey

This is a simple repo I created to work with the `Nlog` package. Nlog is a nuget package for logging in `ASP.NET`.
It is simple to use and also robust. It allows logging to console which is like the default but logging to Databases, Email, Files etc.


Although `Serilog` is quite popular than `Nlog` most tutorials on `Youtube` used serilog as their logging package. Bottomline, `Nlog` is also good.
