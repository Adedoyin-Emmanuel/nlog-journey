# Nlog Journey

This is a simple CLI project to practise `Nlog`. While Nlog is cool, there aren't many tutorials on the net and their docs, it is good but it can be better. I plan to also explore `Serilog`. Coming from `winston` in NodeJS, I am not really a fan of defining my logger config in an `XML` file, although you can do this programmatically but still the `XML` config way is the most approachable.

I will try setting up a logging system with database, file rotation and email with Serilog. But that's it for now.
